\section{Description}\label{sec:description}
For this project I continued using the Evolutionary Algorithm(EA) that I
developed for the previous project. Because of the modularity in the previous
code not that much had to be changed apart from some minor changes to achieve
better performance. As with the last project when needing to adapt the EA to a
new problem one has to extend some core classes for which the default behaviour
is not appropriate. For this project all the extended code can be found in the
file \textit{neuron\.py} which contains all the code to simulate the task at
hand.
